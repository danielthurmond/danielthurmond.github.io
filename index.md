## About Me
Hi, I'm Daniel Thurmond, a digital design and VLSI enthusiast. The purpose of this wiki is to **share knowledge** about the **entire chip design pipeline**â€”from **specification to RTL, verification, physical design, GDS, fabrication, and beyond!**  

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced engineer, **feel free to explore**. This is a **work in progress (WIP)**, and is a personally maintained wiki.
